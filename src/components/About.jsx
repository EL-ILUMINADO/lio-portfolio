        I’m a Full-Stack Developer with a focus on building clean,
        user-friendly, and scalable applications. My expertise lies in React,
        Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I enjoy bringing ideas to life
        through efficient frontend design and solid backend architecture. I
        thrive in projects where I can own the process end-to-end — from
        designing intuitive interfaces to setting up databases and deploying
        applications. Beyond coding, I’m always exploring new tools and best
        practices, from state management with Zustand to deployment strategies
        with Docker and CI/CD pipelines. What drives me is solving problems with
        technology and creating digital experiences that feel seamless for
        users. Whether working independently or collaborating within a team, I
        bring adaptability, attention to detail, and a growth mindset to every
        project.
